## Objective
Our goal is to develop a scalable and secure engine that delivers personalized mental health and wellness content. By analyzing user interactions, mood tracking, and feedback, we predict the most impactful content for each individual user, ranging from meditations and sleep stories to music and educational resources.

## Components
- **Data Ingestion and Storage**: Utilizing cloud storage solutions for raw data management, coupled with SQL/NoSQL databases for structured data.
- **ETL/ELT Pipeline**: Leveraging Apache Airflow and PySpark for robust data processing and preparation.
- **Data Analysis & Machine Learning**: Implementing advanced models for accurate content recommendations and user insights.
- **Infrastructure Management**: Automating cloud resource provisioning with Terraform to ensure scalability and security.
- **APIs & Application Integration**: Providing real-time content delivery through RESTful APIs integrated with the main app.

## Technology Stack
- **Data Storage**: AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob
- **Data Processing**: Apache Airflow, PySpark
- **Machine Learning**: PySpark MLlib, TensorFlow, PyTorch
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform
- **APIs**: Custom-built RESTful services
